# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project
PyBer is a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion.  The CEO has assigned this project to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization.  In order to produce a summary, perform analysis and make recommendations python and Pandas will be used to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and Pandas and Matplotlib will be used to create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.  Rider and city type data .csv files have been provided as the data source.  The final deliverable is a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how these differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use images from the summary DataFrame and multi-line chart and describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.  Based on the results business recommendations need to be made to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

## Results

### Ride-Share Results
There are three ride-share areas, urban, suburban and rural.  As would be expected number of rides and total fares are highest in the urban area as the population and ride-share demand is highest and the lowest number of rides and fares are in the rural area.  The suburban area falls in the middle.  A concern from a business standpoint is the disproportionate number of drivers in the urban area based on ride-share demand and compared to the other two areas.  This in turn results in a much lower average fare per driver in the urban area compared to the other two regions.  The results are as follows:
